# Limitee 1.0.2

Limit ExpressionEngine titles, text input field types, and textarea field types to a specific character count, with a counter to let you know how many characters are remaining. Our thanks to [MD Character Count] for the inspiration behind this add-on.

## Use

To use, extract and put the limitee directory in your system third_party directory. Navigate to the ExpressionEngine extensions area and enable Limitee.

To set up character limits, click on Limitee's settings from the ExpressionEngine extensions page. This will show you a list of your channels, and the fields available to those channels that are eligible for character count and limiting.

If the field is a Title field, Limitee will display in parentheses what ExpressionEngineâ€™s title character limit is set to.

The same applies to the "text input" field type. The limit you have set on that field in the field settings will be shown in parentheses.

## Soft Limit

A soft limit will not enforce the limit, but will present a character count below the field as the user types. When the user has exhausted the remaining characters, the count will turn red but the user can continue typing and the characters will not actually be limited. This is useful if you don't want to cut off user input but want them to know they should be wrapping it up at this point, but it's okay to go a little bit over.

## Hard Limit

A hard limit will still present a character count below the field as with soft limit, but the limit will be strictly imposed. The user will not be allowed to exceed the set character limit.
